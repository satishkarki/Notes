We are pleased to announce the 15th edition of OHM Insights in the new year of 2022. We hope that 2022 will bring you all the health and success. Thanks to the editorial team for their efforts and time  to continue the 15th edition of the newsletter.



Only around 30% of the overall population of our nation is completely vaccinated at the time of publishing of this newsletter. The COVID-19 virus is not yet done with us and the chance of becoming infected and passing it to others—especially indoors – still exists especially with the new Omnicorn variant. Planning ahead can help ensure social interactions are as COVID-19-safe as possible for us and all our loved ones, including those who may not yet be vaccinated.



We all need to be there for each other at times like this. And I sincerely thank the whole Ohm team for their devotion and hard work in helping us achieve so many milestones and developing our company to where it is now! Becoming, for me, isn't about getting there or accomplishing a goal. Instead, I view it as a method of progress, a way of constantly striving to be a better version of ourself. The voyage does not come to an end. Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.



Happy New Year to you my treasured employees. I pray this coming one brings to you all that you please. Lots of joy and bundles of good cheer. 



Stay safe and healthy.
