![Boot Loader](assets/Kernel-boot/bootloader.png)

## A mental model of boot process
```bash
Firmware
  -> Bootloader
     -> kernel entry (arch asm)
        -> start_kernel() [C]
           -> initcalls (drivers/subsystems)
           -> mount initramfs or rootfs
           -> execve("/sbin/init")  => PID 1
              -> userspace boot continues
```

***Kernel Ring Buffer***
It is the Kernel's built-in circular log storage. To view the logs we can use the following commands.

```bash
$ dmesg | less 
$ dmesg -T #human readable timestamps
$ dmesg -w #follow new kernel message live
```
Unlike the ring buffer, the systemd journal is persistent. It is a userspace log store and keeps more history than the ring buffer.

```bash
journalctl -k -b            # kernel logs this boot
journalctl -k -b -1         # previous boot
journalctl -k -p err..alert # only errors and worse
```
***Kernel Parameters***
It is a settings string that tells the kernel how to boot and what environment it's in. The kernel exposes it at `/proc/cmdline`

```bash
$ cat /proc/cmdline

# I am using WSL
# Output
initrd=\initrd.img WSL_ROOT_INIT=1 panic=-1 nr_cpus=20 hv_utils.timesync_implicit=1 console=hvc0 debug pty.legacy_count=0 WSL_ENABLE_CRASH_DUMP=1
```

What is the keyparameter trying to say ?

This cmdline says: boot Linux in a WSL2/Hyper-V VM, use an initrd, use up to 20 CPUs, send kernel logs to the hypervisor console, enable Hyper-V time sync behavior, crank debug verbosity, don’t auto-reboot on panic, and enable WSL crash-dump related behavior.

## Boot Loaders
Here is a funny "chicken-and-egg" problem. 

The function of bootloader is to load the kernel into memory and then start the kernel with a set of kernel paramters.

But where is kernel and kernel parameter? They are somewhere on the root filesystems. But the kernel hasn't started yet !!

***Solution***: Staged Bootstrapping. 

Bootloader uses BIOS/UEFI to access disks. And modern bootloader has the capability to read the partition tables and have built-in support for read-only access to filesystem.

### GRUB
GRand Unified Bootloader (GRUB 2): its core job is to select and load a kernel + initramfs + cmdline, then jump into the kernel.

![alt text](assets/Kernel-boot/grub-menu.png)

 To access the GRUB menu, press and hold `SHIFT` when BIOS or firmware startup screen first appears. Then press `ESC` to temporarily disable the automatic boot timeout after the GRUB menu appears.

You can view the GRUB config editor pressing `e` or comamnd line with `c`.

Lets not get into the weeds with the commands in GRUB CLI. 

***grub.cfg***
```bash
# Location in most distro
/boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
It is not recommended to hand-edit .cfg file for permanent change. Its usually auto generated and updates (kernal updates, update-grub, package upgrades) can overwrite it.

***Where is GRUB installed?***

You install GRUB as an EFI program onto the EFI System Partition (ESP) (a small FAT32 partition, usually mounted at /boot/efi). Then you create a UEFI boot entry in NVRAM (or place a fallback file).

```bash
$ findmnt /boot/efi #Ensure ESP is mounted
$ sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /boot/efi # mount if not
$ sudo grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=GRUB # Install GRUB EFI
$ sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg # Generate config
```
On Ubuntu/Debian you often use `sudo update-grub`, which runs the above generation step.

***What files get created***

You’ll typically see something like:

> /boot/efi/EFI/GRUB/grubx64.efi (the EFI executable)

> /boot/grub/grub.cfg (menu/config)

> /boot/grub/x86_64-efi/* (GRUB modules)

***Where this sits in the boot chain***

> UEFI: Firmware → grubx64.efi on ESP → GRUB menu → kernel


## TLDR
The boot process in Linux is a step-by-step handoff from hardware to software, ending with user-level processes (like your shell or desktop environment).

Here's a simplified overview:
1. BIOS/UEFI Boots: Your computer's firmware loads the bootloader (e.g., GRUB) from the disk.
2. Bootloader Loads Kernel: GRUB finds and loads the Linux kernel into memory.
3. Kernel Initializes: The kernel sets up hardware (CPU, memory, devices), mounts the root filesystem (usually /), and then looks for init.
4. Kernel Starts Init: The kernel executes /sbin/init (or whatever init program is configured). This is where init takes over.
