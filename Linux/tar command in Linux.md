`tar` stands for tape archive. It is used to create an archive or extract the archive. A compressed or uncompressed archive can be created with it. A file with tar extension is commonly called "tarball".

* `file.tar.gz` - means archived and compressed
* `file.gz` - means only compressed, simple `gzip` and `gunzip` command works with it.


> Archive = bundling / packaging multiple things together

> Compress = shrinking / squeezing to save space

### The magic behind configure, make, make install

```bash

make           #Build the software
make install   #Install the software
```

## Example

```bash
# Download the desired .tar.gz or (.tar.bz2) file
# Open Terminal

# Extract the .tar.gz or (.tar.bz2) file with the following commands
tar xvzf PACKAGENAME.tar.gz
tar xvjf PACKAGENAME.tar.bz2

# Navigate to the extracted folder using cd command
cd PACKAGENAME

# Now run the following command to install the tarball
./configure
make
sudo make install
```
